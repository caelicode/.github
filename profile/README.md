### Hey, we're CaeliCode Solutions

We build cloud infrastructure, automate operations, and solve security problems — mostly for small teams that need enterprise-grade tooling without the enterprise price tag.

**What we do:** Cloud & DevOps consulting, platform engineering, cybersecurity, and software development.

**How we work:** Everything is config-driven, version-controlled, and automated. If it can't run in a pipeline, we probably won't build it.
